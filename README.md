AI-Enabled Car Parking System using OpenCV

Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an AI-enabled car parking system utilizing OpenCV. The system analyzes parking area images and videos to detect available parking slots and suggests the optimized parking space to the user. By providing real-time parking slot detection, this solution aims to reduce the time spent searching for available spots, offering users a more efficient and reliable parking experience.


Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to help users identify parking spaces with minimal time consumption, making the parking process smoother and more convenient. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system ensures quick and accurate detection of free parking spots in busy or crowded areas.
